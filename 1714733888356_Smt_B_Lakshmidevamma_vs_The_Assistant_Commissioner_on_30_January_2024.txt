It is the vehement contention of learned counsel that from the date of the sale until dropping of the proceedings, the matter was seized by the revenue authorities under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act and the petitioners could not have made any application under the provisions of SC & ST (PTCL) Act and therefore time spent in agitating the said proceedings by Sri H.
